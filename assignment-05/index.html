            <i>Though it may seem as if all Waterdeep rushes and bustles about with eyes and minds only for their own business at hand, 
            it profits everyone to always remember that part of their business is watching what is unfolding around them, without seeming to, 
            in hopes of seizing on the next big thing, the next road to riches. <br>
            Even if only to sneer, Waterdeep always watches.</i> <br>

           Waterdeep is a common location when it comes to any worldbuilding when it comes to Dungeons and Dragons. A point on multiple trade routes,
           and with a population far surpassing any other city, most books have some location sourced back to Waterdeep. In a minimum, a character may 
           casually reference it in conversation. Waterdeep's population also has specific canonical percentages when it comes to species population, 
           sorted in the following list.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Humans       64%</li>
            <li>Dwarves      10%</li>
            <li>Elves        10%</li>
            <li>Halflings    5%</li>
            <li>Half-Elves   5%</li>
            <li>Gnomes       3%</li>
            <li>Half-Orcs    2%</li>
            <li>Other        1%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Waterdeep is a city that has multiple sourcees commeenting on its broad diversity, so these numbers above tend to be brushed aside by those
            who want to emphasize this fact properly. <br>
            Besides that, however, the city is also known for it's guilds that spread throughout the region. The number of high fame guilds listed in stories
            can vary form 5-20. Most that I have encountered sticks to 8. Most common are the Emerald Enclave, The Grey Hands, The Harpers, the Lord's Alliance, and
            The Order of the Guantlet. Each have their roles in the city, and typically minimize conflict in their stories with one another. The Harpers, though, are 
            the most corruptable and bullheaded of the aforementioned groups.

            Converseley, crime is always brought up in some form or another in the city. The Zhentarim are commonly appear in other cities on the Sword Coast as well,
            A crime syndicate that is known for item and slave trade, beyond typical gang violence. Stories in Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter, and other cities typcially 
            have, in the least, signs of the gang's prescense exist. Their headquarters are not in Waterdeep, but their presence is strong within the city. <br>
            Against the Zhentarim, the Xanathar's Guild is a more pressing threat to Waterdhavian safety. A gang that tends to recruit more "monstous" species, with a high
            presence of goblins, bugbears, and kenku, for example, they present a far stronger underbelly in the city. The Xanathar is a name well known, at least in city walls,
            but what it actually is is not. Most campaigns that interact with the Xanathar's Guild end up with players who wish to investigate further. This leads to the 
            ever so delightful discovery that this crime head is a <b>Beholder</b>, who has no problem turning your party to dust.

            Due to how much is present even in this bare discussion on Waterdeep alone, it is a strong contendor for the most diverse opportunities when it comes to game location
            and story opportunities. Definitely one worth looking into, and a grand example of how broad and deep worldbuilding can be to allow a set ideal, and freedom to create
            one's own things within.
