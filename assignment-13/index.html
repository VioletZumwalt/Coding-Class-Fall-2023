        <h2>Dark Cacao Cookie</h2>

        <p>Dark Cacao Cookie is the leader of the Dark Cacao Kingdom. Known for his resolute dedication in protecting the southern lands from monsters. The Following is his in Game Bio, as are any future italicized blocks.</p>
    </br>
    <p><i>The last bean, devoid of any sweetness, fell down from a withered branch of a lonely cacao tree growing above the edge of a cliff. Lying there in frozen soil, enduring snow and wind, this bean wasn't aware of its destiny to become the main ingredient for the cold and reclusive Dark Cacao Cookie. A warrior of unheard strength, Dark Cacao Cookie wielded the Grapejam Chocoblade. This sword was so heavy it required three average Cookies to even budge it. With each swing, the skies erupted into thunder and lightning, avalanches tumbled down countless mountains. Dark Cacao Cookie was known as a Cookie of few words but great principle. After the Dark Flour War's sorrowful events, the warrior locked himself away in the solitude of his own castle.... Will anything be able to melt his frozen soul once again?</i></p>
</br>
<p>Dark Cacao's core character surrounds the bitterness of a Cacao nib, though he has been written to find more positivity as time goes on. Due to many brushes with backstabbing, he is quick to judge other cookies and their allignments.

            <h2>Caramel Arrow Cookie</h2>

            <p>Caramel Arrow Cookie is the First Watcher of the Dark Cacao Kingdom, Important to the guard, and close to Dark Cacao in both personal and professional duties.</p> <br>
            <p><i>At the very edge of the continent, atop the tall wall of the Black Citadel, stands a figure frowning into the dark. Night and day, all year round, Caramel Arrow Cookie, the First Watcher of the Dark Cacao Kingdom, will always protect the Cookies from the horrors of the Licorice Sea. A master of the Dark Cacao martial art tradition of the perfect balance and a wielder of the black and white twin blades, Caramel Arrow Cookie's loyalty to her king and subordinates remains unwavering even in exile. Some say the kingdom is but a shadow of its former glory, with values like trust becoming a commodity. But a vow is a vow. Standing there atop the tall wall, Caramel Arrow Cookie is staring sharply at the churning dark waters below. The First Watcher will protect the Dark Cacao Kingdom until the very last crumb.</i></p>
   <br>
   <p>Caramel Arrow Cookie's Core is to find injustice and snuff it out. Due to this, and Affogato Cookie's actions, she was banished from the kingdom for a time. She waws welcomed back, and resumed her duties as First Watcher.</p>

            <h2>Crunchy Chip Cookie</h2>
            <p> Crunchy Chip Cookie is a beastmaster of sort, taking care of the Cream Wolves, and standing guard in the woods surrounding the Dark Cacao Kingdom to watch for hostile Monsters </p>
            <br>
            <p><i>One howl is all it takes to prep the Cream Wolves for battle, even in the middle of the night. Led by Crunchy Chip Cookie, this elite squad protects the frozen borders of the Dark Cacao Kingdom. The squad captain may be famous for his quick temper—which is not surprising given the sheer amount of the crunchiest choco chips in his dough—but rest assured: Crunchy Chip Cookie is loyal and reliable, just like his white-maned wolf companion. His oath to his king has kept him and his comrades persevering through piercing winds and snowstorms to ensure the kingdom's safety from the Licorice Sea. No other squadron stands a chance against these ferocious warriors that race through the mountains on the back of their wolves, defeating every monster they come across. Another serene morning in the Dark Cacao Kingdom; perhaps, we have to thank Captain Crunchy Chip Cookie for it!</i></p>
            <br>
            <p>Crunchy Chip Cookie is dedicated and fiercly protective of his kingdom, quick to take offense to naysayers and any who from upon their way of life. He cares heavily for the Cream Wolves, treating them similar how one would treat their dog.</p>

            <h2>Affogato Cookie</h2>
            <p>Previously the Royal Advisor to the Dark Cacao Kingdom, Affogato Cookie found himself banished when his attempts at Regicide fell through. Being pushed off a 40 foot wall was not yet enough to dispatch Dark Cacao Cookie.</p>
            <br>
            <p><i>One piping hot cup of dark roasted coffee and a frozen scoop of the sweetest vanilla ice cream! Born of two desserts—so different yet so delicious—Affogato Cookie's flavor is unparalleled! Neither coffee nor ice cream, Affogato Cookie spent restless years without a place to belong until he came up with a simple solution: to create a land of his own once and for all! He appeared out of nowhere on a frigid night in the Dark Cacao Kingdom and has been busy earning the trust and favor of the locals with the help of his strange concoctions and mysterious chants. These are troubling times for the Dark Cacao Kingdom and the throne is empty... What sinister intention is Affogato Cookie hiding behind his snide smile?</i></p>
            <br>
            <p>Affogato Cookie ran from the punishment that was promised to him, and his whereabouts have been unknown since. Though, there have been sightings of him in other kingdoms.</p>

            <h2>Dark Choco Cookie</h2>
            <p>Son of Dark Cacao Cookie, and the once beloved prince, Dark Choco Cookie was an important figure before his banishment. Having promised to retrieve an artifact that would permanantly protect the kingdom, Dark Choco Cookie left, with dialogue suggesting this would finally allow Dark Cacao to express pride over his actions.</p>
            <br>
            <p><i>Long ago, this Cookie stepped into the world of Darkness to become a hero, but fate had a different plan: Dark Choco Cookie was unfortunate enough to happen upon the forbidden Strawberry Jam Sword. As soon as the would-be hero grasped the weapon, the dark power of the magic sword took over. From that moment on, Dark Choco Cookie's life changed forever. Now, dark clouds and thunderstorms follow this ill-fated Cookie, feared by all. It is said that Dark Choco Cookie is still fighting against the magic sword's control.</i></p>
            <br>
            <p>Having attempted to take his father's life, Dark Choco attempted to take his Father's life. This was used against him by the group who took him in, wanting to renew the Dark Flour War, and he was later brought back to the kingdom, where he attempted to strike the king down again due to Affogato Cookie's plans. This failed once more, and Dark Choco Cookie left on his own accord, vanishing from the eyes of both the Dark Cacao Kingdom, and the perpetrator of the Dark Flour War</p>
