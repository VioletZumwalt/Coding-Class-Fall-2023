    Explain how web browsers function

The browsers retrive files and information uploaded on the cloud and mirror it on your device. This is possible due to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol

    Define and describe DOM

    Dom is the coding interface for HTML and XML projects. It helps sort the project so that it is editable and accessible. It makes website design more legible on the back end.

    What is the difference between HTML XML and XHTML? 

    HTML is the one most common on the web. It is the foundation of the code for the webpage. It displays the webpage nodes.
    XML describes the webpage nodes. They're stored in a simple text format for legibility. More common in email type pages.
    XHMTL is similar to both, but works to fill in some gaps that HTML does not reach. It is a far more precise framework.

    What are the 4 elements your HTML pages need? 
    Head, body, DOCTYPE, and root

    What is the index.html page for? Where does it go? 

    The Index is the master HTML File. It stays on the outer folder in the directory. It helps direct the user towards secondary pages in the directory by serving as a base point.

    Review: What are some of the best naming practices?
    Clarity and Clear Paths are important for any named tree. If I open the images folder, there should be clearly titled images. The most optimal names should allow someone who isn't very faiiliar with code a chance to navigate the files and understand what they're looking through.
